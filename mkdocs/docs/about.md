# About "The House" Web App Game

### Project Overview

"The House" is an interactive web app game designed to offer players an engaging exploration experience through various rooms within a virtual house. Each room in the game is crafted with attention to detail, featuring interactive items and areas that players can interact with. The game is built using modern web technologies, emphasizing a rich user interface and seamless user experience.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Technologies**: The game leverages HTML for its structure, CSS (with Less preprocessor) for styling and graphic design, and JavaScript for dynamic content and interactivity. jQuery is heavily utilized for DOM manipulations, animations, and handling user interactions, playing a crucial role in the game's functionality.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform is used to provision and manage the AWS infrastructure that hosts "The House," ensuring that the game's infrastructure can be reproducibly deployed with version control and automation.

- **Configuration Management**: Ansible automates the configuration and package installation across the servers, ensuring consistent and reproducible environments for the game's deployment and operation.

- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Jenkins is at the heart of the CI/CD pipeline, automating the build, test, and deployment processes. This pipeline ensures that changes to the game are automatically deployed to production environments after passing through the necessary quality checks.

- **Containerization**: Docker is utilized to containerize the game and its supporting services, facilitating consistent deployments across different environments and simplifying dependency management.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana are integrated to provide comprehensive monitoring and visualization of the game's performance metrics. This setup allows for real-time monitoring and alerting, ensuring the game's health and performance are constantly maintained.

### Architecture Overview

The game's architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and maintainable. It consists of several key components:

- **AWS Infrastructure**: Leveraging Terraform, the game is deployed on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for compute.

- **Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**: A Jenkins server orchestrates the buildnand deployment processes, leveraging Docker for containerization of the game and its dependencies. This pipeline enables automated updates and deployments, reducing manual intervention and improving deployment speed and reliability.

- **Ansible for Configuration Management**: Ansible roles are defined for system updates, package installations, Docker setup, and configuration, ensuring that all servers and services are consistently configured according to the project's requirements.

- **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**: A dedicated monitoring stack with Prometheus for data collection and Grafana for data visualization ensures that the game's operations team has clear insights into the system's health and performance.
