# Technical Documentation: Setting Up Docker Credential Helper

This document provides a step-by-step guide for DevOps engineers on setting up Docker Credential Helper using Ansible. Docker Credential Helpers are utilities designed to securely store and access Docker registry credentials. This setup facilitates the management of Docker credentials, improving security and automation in DevOps workflows.

## Overview

The process involves three main steps:
1. **Downloading the Docker Credential Helper**: This step fetches the Docker Credential Helper binary from its official GitHub releases page.
2. **Setting Execute Permission**: After downloading, this step ensures the binary is executable.
3. **Configuring Docker to Use the Credential Helper**: The final step involves creating necessary directories and files for the Docker configuration to use the Credential Helper.

## Detailed Steps and Code Snippets

### 1. Download Docker Credential Helper

The first task downloads the specific version of Docker Credential Helper binary from GitHub and places it in the desired directory.

```yaml
- name: Download Docker Credential Helper
  get_url:
    url: https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases/download/v0.8.1/docker-credential-pass-v0.8.1.linux-amd64
    dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-pass
    mode: '0755'
```

- `get_url`: Ansible module used to download files from a URL.
- `url`: Direct link to the Docker Credential Helper binary.
- `dest`: Destination path where the binary is saved.
- `mode`: Sets the file permission to executable (owner can read, write, and execute).

**Expected Output**: The Docker Credential Helper binary is downloaded and saved to `/usr/local/bin/docker-credential-pass` with executable permissions.

### 2. Set Execute Permission for Docker Credential Helper

Although the download step already sets the file mode, this explicit task ensures that the Docker Credential Helper binary has the execute permission.

```yaml
- name: Set execute permission for Docker Credential Helper
  file:
    path: /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-pass
    mode: '0755'
```

- `file`: Ansible module to manage file properties.
- `path`: Path to the Docker Credential Helper binary.
- `mode`: Ensures the file is executable.

**Expected Output**: The execute permission for the Docker Credential Helper binary is confirmed.

### 3. Set up Docker Credential Helper for User Ubuntu

This block of tasks configures Docker to use the Credential Helper for the user `ubuntu`. It ensures the `.docker` directory exists with proper permissions and configures Docker to use the Credential Helper.

```yaml
- name: Set up Docker Credential Helper for user ubuntu
  become: true
  become_user: ubuntu
  block:
    - name: Ensure .docker directory exists for user ubuntu
      file:
        path: /home/ubuntu/.docker
        state: directory
        mode: '0700'
        owner: ubuntu
        group: ubuntu

    - name: Configure Docker to use Credential Helper for user ubuntu
      copy:
        dest: /home/ubuntu/.docker/config.json
        content: |
          {
            "credsStore": "pass"
          }
        mode: '0600'
        owner: ubuntu
        group: ubuntu
```

- `become` and `become_user`: These directives elevate privileges to the `ubuntu` user for executing these tasks.
- First task ensures the existence of the `.docker` directory with specific permissions and ownership.
- Second task creates or updates the `config.json` file to specify the use of Credential Helper.

**Expected Outputs**:
- A `.docker` directory is created or confirmed at `/home/ubuntu/.docker` with `0700` permissions.
- `config.json` file is created or updated to use `pass` as the credential store, ensuring Docker credentials are managed securely.

## Conclusion

Following these steps, the Docker Credential Helper is set up for the `ubuntu` user, enhancing the security and management of Docker credentials. This setup automates the credential management process.
