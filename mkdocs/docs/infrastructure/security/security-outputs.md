# Outputs Configuration for AWS EC2 Security Groups

#### Overview

This document describes the process of defining an output variable in Terraform to retrieve the ID of an Amazon Web Services (AWS) security group. Output variables in Terraform are used to extract information about the infrastructure, such as IDs, endpoints, and other critical values. This can be useful for referencing in other parts of your Terraform configuration or for using the information outside of Terraform.


#### Code Snippet

```hcl
output "security_group_id" {
  value = aws_security_group.main-security-group.id
}
```

#### Variables

- `output "security_group_id"`: This line declares an output variable named `security_group_id`. Output variables allow you to extract information from your Terraform-managed infrastructure.
- `value =`: This attribute assigns a value to the output variable. In this case, it references the ID of a specific AWS security group.
- `aws_security_group.main-security-group.id`: This is the reference to the ID of an AWS security group that Terraform manages. `aws_security_group` is the resource type for an AWS security group. `main-security-group` is the user-defined name of the security group within the Terraform configuration. `.id` accesses the ID attribute of the security group resource.


#### Conclusion

This document provided a detailed explanation of how to define and use an output variable in Terraform to retrieve the ID of an AWS security group. By incorporating such practices in your Terraform configurations, you can efficiently manage and reference your AWS infrastructure components.
