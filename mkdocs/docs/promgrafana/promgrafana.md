# Deploy Grafana and Prometheus using Ansible

## Overview

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive guide for deploying Grafana and Prometheus on a monitoring server using Ansible. The deployment process involves several key steps, including system updates, package installations, Docker setup, Docker repository configuration, Docker installation, Docker system configuration, and finally, the deployment of Grafana and Prometheus through Docker Compose. This guide includes code snippets along with detailed explanations of each step to ensure a clear understanding of the deployment process.

## Ansible Playbook Breakdown

The Ansible playbook is a YAML file that defines the tasks to be executed on the target hosts. Here's a breakdown of the components and their functionalities in the playbook:

```yaml
- name: Deploy grafana and prometheus
  hosts: monitor
  become: true
  roles:
    - system-update
    - package-installation
    - docker-setup
    - docker-repo-config
    - docker-installation
    - docker-system-config
    - grafana-prometheus
    - docker-compose
```

### Playbook Components

- **name**: This field describes the purpose of the playbook. In this case, it's deploying Grafana and Prometheus.
- **hosts**: Specifies the target hosts group, named `monitor`, where Grafana and Prometheus will be deployed.
- **become**: Enables privilege escalation, allowing tasks to run with root privileges. This is essential for tasks that require administrative permissions.
- **roles**: Defines a list of roles to be executed in the playbook. Each role represents a specific set of tasks aimed at accomplishing part of the deployment process.

### Roles Description

1. **system-update**: Updates the system packages to the latest versions.
2. **package-installation**: Installs necessary packages that are prerequisites for Docker and the monitoring tools.
3. **docker-setup**: Prepares the system for Docker installation, including setting up necessary directories and permissions.
4. **docker-repo-config**: Configures Docker's repository, ensuring that Docker packages are installed from the official source.
5. **docker-installation**: Installs Docker, allowing for containerization of Grafana and Prometheus.
6. **docker-system-config**: Configures Docker system settings, optimizing it for the host's environment.
7. **grafana-prometheus**: Sets up Grafana and Prometheus within Docker containers, configuring them for monitoring purposes.
8. **docker-compose**: Utilizes Docker Compose to manage the Docker containers for Grafana and Prometheus, making it easy to start, stop, and update the services.


## Conclusion

This playbook provides a streamlined and efficient method for deploying Grafana and Prometheus on a server designated for monitoring. By utilizing Ansible roles, the process is modularized, making it easier to manage and understand each step of the deployment. After the successful execution of this playbook, Grafana and Prometheus will be running within Docker containers on the target host, ready to be configured for monitoring the desired systems and services.
