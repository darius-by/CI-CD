# Dockerfile for Jenkins

### Overview

This documentation provides an overview and detailed explanation of a Dockerfile designed for Jenkins build. The Dockerfile extends the Jenkins LTS image to include Docker, allowing Jenkins to build and manage Docker containers. This setup is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where Jenkins needs to interact with Docker for building, testing, and deploying applications.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Base Image

```Dockerfile
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

- **Purpose**: Sets the base image for the Dockerfile. `jenkins/jenkins:lts` is the Long-Term Support version of Jenkins, which provides stability and security for production environments.
- **Expected Output**: This instruction does not produce output during the build but determines the base layer of the resulting Docker image.

#### Switch to Root User

```Dockerfile
USER root
```

- **Purpose**: Switches the user context to `root`. Necessary for installing packages and performing system-level operations.
- **Expected Output**: Subsequent commands will be executed as the root user, allowing for system modifications.

#### Install Dependencies

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update -qq \
 && apt-get install -qqy apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the package lists for the Debian package management system and installs essential packages required for adding new repositories securely. The `-qq` flag minimizes output for clarity.
- **Expected Output**: Installs necessary packages for securely downloading and adding repositories.

#### Add Docker's Official GPG Key

```Dockerfile
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -
```

- **Purpose**: Downloads and adds Docker's official GPG key for verifying the integrity and authenticity of Docker packages.
- **Expected Output**: Docker's GPG key is added, ensuring secure installations.

#### Add Docker's Stable Repository

```Dockerfile
RUN add-apt-repository \
"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

- **Purpose**: Adds Docker's stable repository to the system's software sources. This allows the installation

 of Docker packages from Docker's official repository.
- **Expected Output**: Docker's stable repository is added to the system's list of repositories.

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update -qq \
 && apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the package lists again to ensure it includes Docker's repository changes, then installs Docker Engine, Docker CLI, the containerd runtime, and Docker Compose.
- **Expected Output**: Docker and Docker Compose are installed, enabling the creation, management, and orchestration of Docker containers.

#### Add Jenkins User to the Docker Group

```Dockerfile
RUN usermod -aG docker jenkins
```

- **Purpose**: Adds the `jenkins` user to the `docker` group. This grants the Jenkins user permission to run Docker commands.
- **Expected Output**: Jenkins user can execute Docker commands without requiring root access.

#### Conditional Addition to 'dockerhost' Group

```Dockerfile
RUN getent group dockerhost || true && usermod -aG dockerhost jenkins || true
```

- **Purpose**: Checks if the `dockerhost` group exists and, if so, adds the `jenkins` user to it. This step is conditional and ensures the command does not fail if the group does not exist.
- **Expected Output**: If the `dockerhost` group exists, the Jenkins user is added to it. This is useful in specific configurations where Jenkins needs access to a host's Docker daemon.

#### Change Jenkins User and Group ID

```Dockerfile
RUN usermod -u 1000 jenkins && groupmod -g 1000 jenkins
```

- **Purpose**: Changes the user ID and group ID of the `jenkins` user to `1000`. This is a common practice to avoid permissions issues, especially when mounting volumes between the host and containers.
- **Expected Output**: The `jenkins` user and group IDs are set to `1000`, potentially aligning with host user and group IDs for smoother volume mounting.

#### Switch Back to Jenkins User

```Dockerfile
USER jenkins
```

- **Purpose**: Switches the user context back to `jenkins` for subsequent commands or when running the container. This is a security best practice, as running applications as non-root users reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks.
- **Expected Output**: Ensures the Jenkins service runs with `jenkins` user permissions, enhancing security.

### Conclusion

This Dockerfile provides a robust setup for integrating Docker within a Jenkins environment, enabling DevOps engineers to leverage Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines involving Docker containers. By carefully adding Docker support and adjusting permissions, it ensures Jenkins can manage Docker containers effectively while adhering to security best practices. This setup is crucial for automating the build, test, and deployment processes in a containerized environment.
