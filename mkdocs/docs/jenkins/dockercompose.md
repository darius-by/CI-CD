# Docker Compose

## Overview

This documentation outlines the process of using Ansible to launch Docker Compose. Docker Compose facilitates the deployment of multi-container Docker applications. The provided Ansible playbook includes two primary tasks: launching Docker Compose and displaying the status of the operation.

## Code Snippets and Descriptions

### Task 1: Launch Docker Compose

This task automates the launching of Docker Compose on a remote host. It utilizes the `ansible.builtin.shell` module to execute the Docker Compose command.

**Code Snippet:**

```yaml
- name: Launch Docker Compose
  ansible.builtin.shell:
    cmd: docker compose -f /home/ubuntu/docker-compose.yaml up -d
    chdir: /home/ubuntu
  register: output
```

**Explanation:**

- `name`: Descriptive name of the task.
- `ansible.builtin.shell`: Ansible module used to execute shell commands on the target machine.
  - `cmd`: The command to execute. Here, it's `docker compose -f /home/ubuntu/docker-compose.yaml up -d`, which tells Docker Compose to start the services defined in `/home/ubuntu/docker-compose.yaml` in detached mode (`-d`), allowing the terminal to be freed up while the containers run in the background.
  - `chdir`: Changes the working directory to `/home/ubuntu` before executing the command. This is where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is located.
- `register`: Saves the output of the command to the variable `output`, which can be used in subsequent tasks for debugging or validation purposes.

**Expected Output:**

The command does not output detailed information due to the `-d` (detached mode) flag but successfully starts the Docker containers specified in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. The `output` variable will contain information about the command execution, including stdout, stderr, and exit status.

### Task 2: Show Status

This task displays the output of the Docker Compose launch command for verification and debugging purposes.

**Code Snippet:**

```yaml
- name: Show status
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: output
```

**Explanation:**

- `name`: Descriptive name of the task.
- `ansible.builtin.debug`: Ansible module used for debugging purposes. It prints the value of a variable to the log output.
  - `var`: Specifies the variable whose contents will be displayed. In this case, `output` contains the result from the Docker Compose launch task.

**Expected Output:**

The output of this task will include details of the command execution from the `output` variable, such as standard output (stdout), standard error (stderr), and the exit code. If the Docker Compose command was successful, the exit code should be 0. Any messages printed to stdout or stderr during the execution will also be displayed, which can help in troubleshooting if needed.

## Conclusion

The above playbook demonstrates a simple yet effective method for launching Docker Compose and verifying the operation's success through Ansible's debug capabilities. This approach can be extended and customized to fit a wide range of deployment scenarios, making it a versatile tool in a DevOps engineer's arsenal.
